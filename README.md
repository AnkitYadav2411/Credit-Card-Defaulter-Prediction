ðŸ’¸Credit Card Default Prediction
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats faced by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history

ðŸ“Š Data Source
In our dataset we have 25 columns which reflect various attributes of the customer. The target column is default.payment.next.month which reflects wether the customer defaulted or not. Our aim is to predict the probability of default given the payment history of the customer. I have built my model using a public dataset available on kaggle.
